# Titanic
<big>Analysis and predictions of the Titanic data set from Kaggle</big>

## 1. Goals and Assumptions

### Primary goal: Predict the survival of passengers in the test group</big>
* Of the various features (e.g. age, social class, ticket fare), engineer them to be suitable to be fed into a machine learning algorithm
* Train various machine learning models to make predictions of survival
* Compare the outcome of the models based on metrics like classifcation reports and confusion matrices

### Secondary goal: Determine which features are the most important predictors.</big>
* Trial/Error: What happens to the predictions when particular features are excluded from the training model (are they improved or deteriorated)?
### Secondary goal:  Determine why the best performing model fits the data.</big>
* Statistical theory: What is the intended use of the model, and what attributes of the data make it an appropriate fit?

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

### Primary goal: Find clues to meaningful relationships amongst the data: Identify critical predictors.</big>
* Which features have a stark impact on survival?
* Display these relationships in a simple, obvious manner for a non-technical audience (i.e. visualization).

### Secondary goal: Demonstrate interesting relationships amongst the data, even if they do not correlate to critical predictors.</big>
* The definition of "interesting" will depend on the intended audience (e.g. cruiseline selling tickets for, or shipyard building Titanic MarkII; agency conduction safety investigations or social bias in state of emergency).

## 3. Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering

### Primary goal: Prepare the features to be fed into machine learning algorithm.</big>
* Some of the predictors are binary or class-based. 

## 4. Valuation, Machine Learning Analysis
* In this case, I am building a classifier which means some statistical models are less appropriate.
